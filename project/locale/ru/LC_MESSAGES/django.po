"\n"
"        Hand-to-hand combat originated in ancient times, when people sought "
"to protect themselves and their settlements\n"
"        by creating ways of fighting without using weapons. It developed in "
"different cultures of the world\n"
"        independently of each other, forming as an art of self-defense and a "
"martial craft. Ancient warriors in Egypt,\n"
"        India, Greece and China studied hand-to-hand techniques to protect "
"the warrior and enhance their military\n"
"        skills. In Ancient Greece, such types of wrestling as pankration, an "
"ancient sport combining elements of boxing\n"
"        and wrestling, which was popular even at the Olympic Games, were "
"especially developed. In the East, hand-to-hand\n"
"        combat was especially developed. Martial arts systems originated in "
"India,\n"
"        which then spread to China, giving rise to kung fu. In Japan, such "
"disciplines as judo, aikido, karate and judo\n"
"        were formed, which today have become the basis for various schools "
"of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat\n"
"        throughout the world. Europe also had its own traditions of hand-to-"
"hand combat. For example, French savate and\n"
"        English boxing\n"
"        developed as sports and military disciplines, and in the Middle "
"Ages, hand-to-hand combat was an integral part\n"
"        of knightly training. Over time, many of these techniques became "
"popular as sports.\n"
"        In the 20th century, armies in different countries began to develop "
"specialized hand-to-hand combat systems to\n"
"        train\n"
"        soldiers, which led to the creation of modern combat techniques. For "
"example, the Soviet Union developed the\n"
"        sambo system, which combined techniques from judo, jiu-jitsu, and "
"various national types of wrestling. These\n"
"        techniques\n"
"        were adapted for combat needs and included not only defense, but "
"also methods of effective attack.\n"
"        Today, hand-to-hand combat is used for both sports and military "
"purposes. Sports competitions in hand-to-hand\n"
"        combat include various striking and wrestling techniques, and also "
"remain popular in training for law\n"
"        enforcement agencies and security services. Many schools and clubs "
"teach hand-to-hand combat as a self-defense\n"
"        technique, attracting people of different ages to classes. In "
"addition to physical training, hand-to-hand combat\n"
"        contributes to the development of spirit, discipline and respect for "
"the opponent,\n"
"        forming a strong character and the ability to concentrate. Modern "
"hand-to-hand combat federations hold\n"
"        international competitions and seminars, promoting the "
"popularization of this martial art and making it\n"
"        accessible to people around the world. Hand-to-hand combat continues "
"to develop, contributing to physical\n"
"        education and training of specialists, playing an important role in "
"the sports and defense systems of various\n"
"        countries.\n"
