            Hand-to-hand combat originated in ancient times, when people sought to protect themselves and their settlements
            by creating ways of fighting without using weapons. It developed in different cultures of the world
            independently of each other, forming as an art of self-defense and a martial craft. Ancient warriors in Egypt,
            India, Greece and China studied hand-to-hand techniques to protect the warrior and enhance their military
            skills. In Ancient Greece, such types of wrestling as pankration, an ancient sport combining elements of boxing
            and wrestling, which was popular even at the Olympic Games, were especially developed. In the East, hand-to-hand
            combat was especially developed. Martial arts systems originated in India,
            which then spread to China, giving rise to kung fu. In Japan, such disciplines as judo, aikido, karate and judo
            were formed, which today have become the basis for various schools of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat
            throughout the world. Europe also had its own traditions of hand-to-hand combat. For example, French savate and
            English boxing
            developed as sports and military disciplines, and in the Middle Ages, hand-to-hand combat was an integral part
            of knightly training. Over time, many of these techniques became popular as sports.
            In the 20th century, armies in different countries began to develop specialized hand-to-hand combat systems to
            train
            soldiers, which led to the creation of modern combat techniques. For example, the Soviet Union developed the
            sambo system, which combined techniques from judo, jiu-jitsu, and various national types of wrestling. These
            techniques
            were adapted for combat needs and included not only defense, but also methods of effective attack.
            Today, hand-to-hand combat is used for both sports and military purposes. Sports competitions in hand-to-hand
            combat include various striking and wrestling techniques, and also remain popular in training for law
            enforcement agencies and security services. Many schools and clubs teach hand-to-hand combat as a self-defense
            technique, attracting people of different ages to classes. In addition to physical training, hand-to-hand combat
            contributes to the development of spirit, discipline and respect for the opponent,
            forming a strong character and the ability to concentrate. Modern hand-to-hand combat federations hold
            international competitions and seminars, promoting the popularization of this martial art and making it
            accessible to people around the world. Hand-to-hand combat continues to develop, contributing to physical
            education and training of specialists, playing an important role in the sports and defense systems of various
            countries.
